# audio-to-midi

Idea of this repository is to trasnlate whistling into MIDI data. The goal is that I can whistle a tune and a virtual instrument (like [SWAM Flute](https://audiomodeling.com/solo-woodwinds/swam-flutes/)) can play the melody exactly as it was whistled.

## Demo video

I made a quick funny [video](https://youtu.be/J1seqcRTEOc) showcasing how the project works.

## How to use

If you are suicidal enough to try this project at this stage, here are the instructions.

- You need [LoopBe1](https://www.nerds.de/en/loopbe1.html) virtual MIDI device in order to play the MIDI data.
- Microphone
- [Download app](https://github.com/porrasm/audio-to-midi)
